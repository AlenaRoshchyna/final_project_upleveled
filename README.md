## How does the website work
Wada-Art is a website where you can create an account, set up your profile, and add your favourite artworks to a wishlist. If you have question to the artist, you can easily write an email by pressing "Contact the artist" button. Wada-Art is an art gallery, where you can enjoy the art and connect with the artist.

## Goal of creating the application
I have created this website for my friend who escaped from a dictatorship country, Belarus. Since moving to Austria, she has been dedicated to advancing her art skills. Her ultimate goal is to perform in a large auditorium and earn a living through her passion for art.
